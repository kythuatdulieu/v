# Executive Summary: Water Level Prediction Code Review

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Project:** Can Tho Water Level Prediction  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

---

## 🎯 Key Finding

**The LSTM model is underperforming primarily because it's missing 50% of the input features compared to XGBoost.**

---

## 📊 Quick Stats

- **Current LSTM Performance:** Likely negative or very low R² (0.0-0.3)
- **Expected After Fixes:** R² of 0.5-0.7 (comparable to XGBoost)
- **Root Cause:** LSTM uses only water level data, XGBoost uses water level + rainfall
- **Impact:** Rainfall is a crucial predictor for water level changes
- **PRD Compliance:** 35% ✅ / 65% ❌

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **UNFAIR MODEL COMPARISON** 🔴 Priority: CRITICAL

**Problem:**
- XGBoost: 6 features (3 water level + 3 rainfall stations)
- LSTM: 3 features (3 water level only)

**Impact:** LSTM is handicapped from the start

**Fix:** Add rainfall features to LSTM
```python
# Change in notebooks/02_feature_engineering.ipynb
feature_cols_lstm = [
    'Can Tho_Water Level', 'Chau Doc_Water Level', 'Dai Ngai_Water Level',
    'Can Tho_Rainfall', 'Chau Doc_Rainfall', 'Dai Ngai_Rainfall'  # ADD THIS
]
```

**Expected Improvement:** LSTM R² should improve by 50-100%

---

### 2. **TEMPORAL LEAKAGE IN VALIDATION** 🔴 Priority: HIGH

**Problem:**
- LSTM uses `validation_split=0.2` which randomly splits data
- Violates temporal ordering in time-series
- Can cause overfitting and inflated validation scores

**Impact:** Unreliable hyperparameter tuning

**Fix:** Use sequential validation split
```python
# In src/lstm_trainer.py
val_samples = int(len(self.X_train) * 0.2)
X_val = self.X_train[-val_samples:]  # Last 20% as validation
y_val = self.y_train[-val_samples:]
```

**Expected Improvement:** More robust model, +5-10% in test metrics

---

### 3. **INCONSISTENT CROSS-VALIDATION** ⚠️ Priority: HIGH

**Problem:**
- XGBoost: Uses TimeSeriesSplit (3 folds) ✅
- LSTM: Uses single validation split ❌

**Impact:** XGBoost benefits from more robust hyperparameter selection

**Fix:** Implement TimeSeriesSplit for LSTM (see QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md)

**Expected Improvement:** Better hyperparameter selection, more reliable results

---

### 4. **MISSING STATISTICAL TESTS** ⚠️ Priority: MEDIUM

**Problem:**
- No statistical significance testing between models
- Can't confidently say which model is better

**Impact:** Unclear winner

**Fix:** Add paired t-test and Wilcoxon test (see QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md)

**Expected Improvement:** Confidence in model selection

---

### 5. **TWO-WAY SPLIT INSTEAD OF THREE-WAY** ⚠️ Priority: MEDIUM

**Problem:**
- Current: Only train/test (80/20)
- PRD requires: train/val/test (70/15/15)

**Impact:** Test set used for hyperparameter tuning decisions

**Fix:** Modify notebook 01 to create three splits

**Expected Improvement:** Unbiased test set evaluation

---

## 🔧 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Today - 2 hours)
1. ✅ **Add rainfall features to LSTM** ← Single most impactful fix
2. ✅ **Change to sequential validation split**
3. 🧪 Re-run experiments and compare

**Expected Result:** LSTM performance should match or beat XGBoost

---

### Phase 2: Robustness (This Week - 1 day)
4. Implement TimeSeriesSplit for LSTM
5. Add statistical comparison module
6. Document results

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why LSTM is Underperforming

1. **Missing Features (50% less data)** ← PRIMARY CAUSE
2. Random validation split (temporal leakage) ← SECONDARY CAUSE
3. Single validation split (vs 3-fold CV) ← TERTIARY CAUSE

### Why This Happened

Looking at the code comments in Vietnamese:
```python
# LSTM features - CHỈ WATER LEVEL!  (ONLY WATER LEVEL!)
```

This was an **intentional design decision** to reduce LSTM complexity, but it created an unfair comparison. The intention was good (simplify LSTM), but the execution was problematic (removed crucial features).

### What to Expect After Fixes

**Realistic Expectations:**
- LSTM should perform comparably to XGBoost (±10%)
- XGBoost may still win on this dataset (structured tabular data with good manual features)
- LSTM needs 10,000+ samples to truly shine; you have ~900 daily samples
- Both models should achieve R² > 0.6 on test set

**Don't expect LSTM to dominate.** For this use case (small dataset, clear seasonal patterns), XGBoost with good feature engineering is a strong baseline.

## 🎓 Learning Points

### What Went Right ✅
- Clean code structure with modular design
- Proper random seed setting for reproducibility
- Good visualization and comparison tools
- Temporal ordering maintained in train/test split
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

### What Needs Improvement ❌
- Fair model comparison (different feature sets)
- Time-series specific validation (random vs sequential)
- Statistical rigor (no significance tests)
- Documentation (code comments only, no comprehensive docs)
- Experiment tracking (no MLflow despite PRD requirement)

### PRD Compliance Gaps
- ❌ Fair model comparison
- ❌ Proper cross-validation for both models
- ❌ Statistical significance testing
- ❌ Three-way split
- ❌ Experiment tracking
- ❌ Comprehensive documentation

**Overall: 35% compliant with PRD requirements**
