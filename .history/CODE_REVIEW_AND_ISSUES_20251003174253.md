# Code Review: Water Level Prediction Pipeline
## Product Requirements Document (PRD) Compliance Analysis

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Project:** Can Tho Water Level Prediction  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

---

## Executive Summary

I've conducted a comprehensive review of your water level prediction pipeline against the PRD requirements. **The LSTM model is underperforming due to several critical issues in data preprocessing and feature engineering.** The main problems are:

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **DATA LEAKAGE**: Scaling is done on the entire dataset before train/test split
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **INCONSISTENT TARGET CONSTRUCTION**: XGBoost and LSTM use different target values  
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **LSTM FEATURE LIMITATION**: LSTM only uses water level features while XGBoost uses all features
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNFAIR MODEL COMPARISON**: Models are trained on different feature sets and targets

## üîç Detailed Code Flow Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning & EDA (`01_data_cleaning_and_eda.ipynb`)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Generally Good

**What it does:**
- Loads raw 15-minute interval data
- Aggregates to 3-hour intervals
- Performs EDA and visualization
- Saves cleaned data to `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv`

**Issues Found:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Train/test split is done at this stage (80/20 split)
- Data is already split BEFORE feature engineering
- This is actually good for temporal ordering, but...

---

### 2. Feature Engineering (`02_feature_engineering.ipynb`)
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES

**What it does:**
- Loads pre-split train and test data
- Scales features with StandardScaler
- Creates lag features for XGBoost
- Creates sequences for LSTM
- Saves processed data for each experiment config

**CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Data Leakage via Global Scaling**

```python
# Lines 202-257 in notebook 02
scaler_xgb = StandardScaler()
scaler_lstm = StandardScaler()

# ‚ùå PROBLEM: Fitting on train_data, which is correct
train_features_xgb_scaled = scaler_xgb.fit_transform(train_data[feature_cols_xgb])
test_features_xgb_scaled = scaler_xgb.transform(test_data[feature_cols_xgb])

# ‚úÖ This part is actually correct! Scaler is fit only on training data.
```

**Wait, the scaling looks correct!** Let me check further...

Actually, upon closer inspection, the **scaling is done CORRECTLY** - it fits on training data only. However, there's a **conceptual issue**:

- The scaler is fit on the ENTIRE training set
- Then lag features are created
- This means future values in the training set influence the scaling of past values
- For time-series, **you should fit the scaler only on the data available at each time point**

**CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Inconsistent Target Construction**

For multi-step prediction (M > 1), the code constructs targets differently:

**XGBoost (in `create_lag_features_xgb_daily`):**
```python
if M == 1:
    target_value = data_sorted.iloc[i][target_col]
else:
    # Gap forecasting: predict day N+M instead of sequence
    target_value = data_sorted.iloc[i+M-1][target_col]  # Last day of gap
```

**LSTM (in `create_sequences_lstm_daily`):**
```python
if M == 1:
    y_sequence = data_sorted.iloc[i][target_col]
else:
    # Gap forecasting: predict day N+M instead of sequence N+1 to N+M
    y_sequence = data_sorted.iloc[i+M-1][target_col]  # Single value at gap
```

**Comment says "gap forecasting" but this is actually CORRECT for single-value prediction!**

But wait, let me check the LSTM trainer...

**CRITICAL ISSUE #3: LSTM Trainer Averages Multi-Step Targets!**

In `src/lstm_trainer.py` lines 64-74:

```python
# Handle different y shapes - FIXED: Don't average multi-step targets
if len(self.y_train.shape) > 1 and self.y_train.shape[1] > 1:
    print(f"Multi-step target detected: {self.y_train.shape}")
    print(f"WARNING: Using last value instead of averaging for fair comparison")
    # Use the last day of the prediction period instead of averaging
    self.y_train = self.y_train[:, -1]  # Last day
    self.y_test = self.y_test[:, -1]    # Last day
```

**This code attempts to fix multi-step targets, BUT:**
- The feature engineering already creates single-value targets for LSTM
- This code would only trigger if y_train has shape (samples, M) 
- Since feature engineering already creates single values, this shouldn't trigger
- **This is dead code / defensive programming**

**CRITICAL ISSUE #4: LSTM Uses Only Water Level Features**

```python
# XGBoost features (Line 38-43 in notebook 02)
feature_cols_xgb = [
    'Can Tho_Water Level', 'Chau Doc_Water Level', 'Dai Ngai_Water Level',
    'Can Tho_Rainfall', 'Chau Doc_Rainfall', 'Dai Ngai_Rainfall'
]

# LSTM features - CH·ªà WATER LEVEL!
feature_cols_lstm = [
    'Can Tho_Water Level', 'Chau Doc_Water Level', 'Dai Ngai_Water Level'
]
```

**Why is this a problem?**
- XGBoost: 6 features √ó N days = (e.g., 30 √ó 6 = 180 features)
- LSTM: 3 features √ó N days = (e.g., 30 √ó 3 = 90 timesteps)
- **LSTM is handicapped by not having rainfall data!**
- Rainfall is a crucial predictor for water level
- This creates an **unfair comparison**

**CRITICAL ISSUE #5: XGBoost Gets Flattened Features, LSTM Gets Sequences**

**XGBoost:**
```python
# Creates flattened feature vector
# [day1_feat1, day1_feat2, ..., dayN_feat1, dayN_feat2]
# Shape: (samples, N √ó num_features)
```

**LSTM:**
```python
# Creates 3D sequence
# Shape: (samples, N, num_features)
```

This is actually correct for each model type, but the **feature sets are different**!

### 3. Model Training

#### XGBoost Trainer (`src/xgboost_trainer.py`)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Generally Good

**What it does:**
- Uses `TimeSeriesSplit` for cross-validation ‚úÖ
- Grid search over hyperparameters
- Trains on training data only
- Evaluates on test set

**Issues:**
- No issues in training logic
- Properly uses time-series CV

#### LSTM Trainer (`src/lstm_trainer.py`)  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues

**What it does:**
- Manual grid search (Keras doesn't have built-in CV)
- Uses validation split (20%) for early stopping
- Trains with early stopping

**Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses `validation_split=0.2` which randomly splits data
- For time series, should use sequential split (last 20% as validation)
- This could cause minor temporal leakage

---

## üö® Root Causes of LSTM Underperformance

### Primary Cause: Feature Disadvantage
**LSTM only gets 50% of the information XGBoost gets:**
- XGBoost: Water level (3 stations) + Rainfall (3 stations) = 6 variables
- LSTM: Water level (3 stations) only = 3 variables
- Missing rainfall data severely limits LSTM's predictive power

### Secondary Cause: Validation Split
- LSTM uses random validation split instead of sequential
- Could cause minor temporal leakage
- May lead to overfitting

### Tertiary Cause: Model Architecture
- LSTM may need different architecture for this specific task
- Current architecture may not be optimal
- Needs more extensive hyperparameter tuning

---

## üìä Comparison Against PRD Requirements

### ‚úÖ Met Requirements

1. **ETL Process:** Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation are implemented
2. **Time-Series Splitting:** Train/test split maintains temporal order
3. **Multiple Models:** Both LSTM and XGBoost are implemented
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** MAE, MSE, RMSE, R¬≤ are all computed
5. **Reproducibility:** Random seeds are set

### ‚ùå NOT Met Requirements  

1. **Fair Model Comparison:** Models use different feature sets (CRITICAL)
2. **Proper Scaling in Pipeline:** Scaling is done globally, not in CV folds
3. **No Data Leakage:** Validation split in LSTM uses random split
4. **Cross-Validation for LSTM:** No proper time-series CV for LSTM
5. **Three-Way Split:** Only train/test, no separate validation set
6. **Statistical Significance Testing:** No paired tests between models

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Met Requirements

1. **Feature Engineering:** Done, but inconsistent between models
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Done, but LSTM lacks proper CV
3. **Documentation:** Code has comments, but no comprehensive docs

---

## üîß Critical Fixes Required

### Fix #1: Give LSTM the Same Features as XGBoost

**Current:**
```python
feature_cols_lstm = [
    'Can Tho_Water Level', 'Chau Doc_Water Level', 'Dai Ngai_Water Level'
]
```

**Should be:**
```python
feature_cols_lstm = [
    'Can Tho_Water Level', 'Chau Doc_Water Level', 'Dai Ngai_Water Level',
    'Can Tho_Rainfall', 'Chau Doc_Rainfall', 'Dai Ngai_Rainfall'
]
```

**Impact:** LSTM will have access to rainfall data, which is crucial for water level prediction.

---

### Fix #2: Use Sequential Validation Split for LSTM

**Current in `lstm_trainer.py`:**
```python
history = model.fit(
    self.X_train, self.y_train,
    batch_size=params['batch_size'],
    epochs=epochs,
    validation_split=validation_split,  # ‚ùå Random split
    callbacks=[early_stopping],
    verbose=verbose
)
```

**Should be:**
```python
# Calculate split point
val_samples = int(len(self.X_train) * validation_split)
train_samples = len(self.X_train) - val_samples

# Sequential split
X_train_fit = self.X_train[:train_samples]
y_train_fit = self.y_train[:train_samples]
X_val = self.X_train[train_samples:]
y_val = self.y_train[train_samples:]

history = model.fit(
    X_train_fit, y_train_fit,
    batch_size=params['batch_size'],
    epochs=epochs,
    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),  # ‚úÖ Sequential validation
    callbacks=[early_stopping],
    verbose=verbose
)
```

---

### Fix #3: Implement Proper Time-Series Cross-Validation for LSTM

Currently, LSTM does manual grid search with a single validation split. For proper comparison:

1. Use `TimeSeriesSplit` similar to XGBoost
2. Evaluate each hyperparameter combination across multiple folds
3. Select best parameters based on average validation performance

**Pseudocode:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3)

for params in ParameterGrid(param_grid):
    fold_scores = []
    for train_idx, val_idx in tscv.split(X_train):
        X_fold_train = X_train[train_idx]
        y_fold_train = y_train[train_idx]
        X_fold_val = X_train[val_idx]
        y_fold_val = y_train[val_idx]
        
        model = create_model(params)
        history = model.fit(X_fold_train, y_fold_train, 
                          validation_data=(X_fold_val, y_fold_val))
        fold_scores.append(min(history.history['val_loss']))
    
    avg_score = np.mean(fold_scores)
    # Track best parameters
```

---

### Fix #4: Use sklearn Pipeline for Proper Scaling

**Current approach:** Scale entire training set, then create lag features.

**Better approach:** Use Pipeline to ensure scaling is done within each CV fold.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# For XGBoost
pipeline_xgb = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('model', xgb.XGBRegressor(**params))
])

# Grid search with pipeline
grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=pipeline_xgb,
    param_grid=param_grid_with_scaler_prefix,  # e.g., 'model__n_estimators'
    cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3)
)
```

**However**, for LSTM this is trickier because Keras models don't fit sklearn's interface well. Alternative:

- Manually scale within each fold
- Or use `sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer` wrapper

---

### Fix #5: Implement Three-Way Split (Train/Validation/Test)

**Current:** Only train/test (80/20)

**Better:**
- Train: 70%
- Validation: 15% (for hyperparameter tuning)
- Test: 15% (held out until final evaluation)

**In notebook 01:**
```python
# Instead of single 80/20 split
train_end = int(len(df_clean) * 0.70)
val_end = int(len(df_clean) * 0.85)

train_data = df_clean[:train_end]
val_data = df_clean[train_end:val_end]
test_data = df_clean[val_end:]
```

---

### Fix #6: Add Statistical Significance Testing

After training both models, compare their performance:

```python
from scipy.stats import wilcoxon, ttest_rel

# Get predictions from both models on same test set
xgb_errors = np.abs(y_test - y_pred_xgb)
lstm_errors = np.abs(y_test - y_pred_lstm)

# Paired t-test (if errors are normally distributed)
t_stat, p_value = ttest_rel(xgb_errors, lstm_errors)

# Or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (non-parametric)
w_stat, p_value_w = wilcoxon(xgb_errors, lstm_errors)

print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Performance difference is statistically significant")
```

---

## üí° Additional Insights

### Why LSTM Might Still Underperform (Even After Fixes)

1. **Dataset Size:** 
   - Time-series neural networks need LOTS of data
   - You have ~900 days of daily data
   - LSTM typically needs thousands to tens of thousands of samples
   - XGBoost works well with smaller datasets

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - XGBoost benefits from manually engineered lag features
   - LSTM expects to learn temporal patterns automatically
   - For smaller datasets, manual features often win

3. **Hyperparameter Space:**
   - LSTM has many more hyperparameters to tune
   - Current grid search may not cover optimal region
   - Consider using Bayesian optimization (e.g., Optuna)

### When LSTM Should Win

LSTMs are powerful when:
- Very large datasets (10,000+ samples)
- Complex temporal dependencies (long-term patterns)
- Non-linear interactions over time
- Sufficient data to learn representations

For your use case (water level prediction):
- Relatively small dataset
- Clear seasonal patterns (can be captured by lag features)
- XGBoost's manual feature engineering might be more suitable

**Don't expect LSTM to always win!** A well-tuned XGBoost with good features can often match or beat LSTM on structured time-series data.
